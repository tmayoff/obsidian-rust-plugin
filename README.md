Sample Obsidian plugin written in rust.

I hope to extend obsidian-rs enough to use in my 'real' plugin.

**Previous work**
- https://github.com/trashhalo/obsidian-rust-plugin
- https://github.com/rachtsingh/obsidian-rust-template
Both of these require a bit of 'extra' to load the wasm generated from vite eliminates the need for that, (see main.ts for loading the plugin)
